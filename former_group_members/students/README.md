This directory is meant to document the work of former students including data locations, source code, etc.

A directory should be created for each leaving student holding a markdown file called 'documentation.md' and, optionally, source code to be archived if not available elsewhere.

If referring to an external GitHub repository, a tag should be created to serve as a code snapshot at the time of leaving.
